# CPU Scheduling Algorithm Visualizer

## Project Overview
The CPU Scheduling Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive platform designed to simulate various CPU scheduling algorithms, including First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), Priority, and other popular algorithms. 

This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience for students, educators, and professionals interested in understanding CPU scheduling algorithms and their practical applications.
